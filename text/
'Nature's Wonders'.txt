original text - 

Verse 1

Out in Nature, I'm free to explore,
Discovering the beauty under the sun;
The world around us is so much more,
Than what we can see, when we look around.

Chorus

Oh, Nature, you give us so much to see,
The wonders of life, out in the wild;
And in the outdoors, we can be free,
Nature will be here, for us all the while.

Verse 2

The rolling hills and the babbling streams,
The forests and the mountain air;
The beauty of Nature is so grand,
The world is full of mystery, everywhere.

Chorus

Oh, Nature, you give us so much to see,
The wonders of life, out in the wild;
And in the outdoors, we can be free,
Nature will be here, for us all the while.

Bridge

Let us take care of the world around us,
And all of its glory, from the sea to the sky;
Let us cherish Nature, and love every sound,
The beauty of Nature will never die.

Chorus

Oh, Nature, you give us so much to see,
The wonders of life, out in the wild;
And in the outdoors, we can be free,
Nature will be here, for us all the while.
