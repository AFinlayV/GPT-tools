original text - 

Verse 1:
I thought I could never feel this way
So broken, so lost, so much pain
I thought I could never survive this heartbreak
But I'm here, I'm still standing, I'm still awake

Chorus:
Heartbreak, it's like a storm that never ends
It's like a dark cloud that's always looming
Heartbreak, it's like a weight on my shoulders
But I won't let it keep me from moving on

Verse 2:
I used to be so strong, so sure of myself
But now I'm struggling to find my way
I used to have a plan, but now I'm left in the dark
And I'm not sure what the future holds for me

Chorus:
Heartbreak, it's like a storm that never ends
It's like a dark cloud that's always looming
Heartbreak, it's like a weight on my shoulders
But I won't let it keep me from moving on

Bridge:
I'm gonna pick myself up and keep on going
I'm gonna find the strength to keep on believing
I'm gonna keep my head up and keep my faith
I'm gonna keep on living and keep on dreaming

Chorus:
Heartbreak, it's like a storm that never ends
It's like a dark cloud that's always looming
Heartbreak, it's like a weight on my shoulders
But I won't let it keep me from moving on
