Verse 1:
Life is never easy, no matter what we try
It gets harder when the darkness starts to swallow up the light
But in the midst of all the chaos, we must find the courage to keep going on

Chorus:
So let's stand up and fight, put our troubles aside
Let's break through the walls of adversity and rise 
Let's find our strength and courage, and stand up for what is right
Let's overcome any obstacle that comes our way

Verse 2:
When we feel like giving up, let's choose to keep pushing through
Let's reach deep down inside, and find the strength to make it through
No matter how hard things get, we must continue to strive
We can make it through this together, united side by side

Chorus:
So let's stand up and fight, put our troubles aside
Let's break through the walls of adversity and rise 
Let's find our strength and courage, and stand up for what is right
Let's overcome any obstacle that comes our way

Bridge:
We can do this, we can make it through
Let's never give up, and never be scared
Let's stay strong, and keep our heads up high
And no matter what, never lose our hope and faith

Chorus:
So let's stand up and fight, put our troubles aside
Let's break through the walls of adversity and rise 
Let's find our strength and courage, and stand up for what is right
Let's overcome any obstacle that comes our way
