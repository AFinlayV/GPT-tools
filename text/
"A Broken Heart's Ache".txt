original text - 

Verse 1
The pain of my loss is too much to bear
My heart is heavy, and it's hard to care
The world has no solace for me to share
My broken heart does not know where to start

Chorus
My broken heart's aching for the love that's gone
It's hard to let go when all I hear is a song
The sorrow I feel is too deep to ignore
This broken heart of mine will never be restored

Verse 2
My soul is empty, my heart is so frail
My spirit is broken, I'm destined to fail
My loss is a reminder of what once was
And how empty my life has become because

Chorus
My broken heart's aching for the love that's gone
It's hard to let go when all I hear is a song
The sorrow I feel is too deep to ignore
This broken heart of mine will never be restored

Bridge
The grief I feel is ever present
No matter what I do, I can't forget
The memories of our love, still linger on
It's hard to move on, when I'm feeling so alone

Chorus
My broken heart's aching for the love that's gone
It's hard to let go when all I hear is a song
The sorrow I feel is too deep to ignore
This broken heart of mine will never be restored
