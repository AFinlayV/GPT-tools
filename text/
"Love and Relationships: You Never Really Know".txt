original text - 

Verse 1:

Left with a broken heart, I'm feeling so alone
I thought I could trust you, but you chose to move on
Now I'm lost in a mess, I need something real
A love that won't bring me pain and something I can feel

Chorus:
Love and relationships, so much to bear
It can bring so much joy and also despair
When it's right it will be true, when it's wrong it will show
Love and relationships, you never really know

Verse 2:

Tried to take a chance, but it just wasn't meant to be
Wanted to make it work, but it just wouldn't agree
No one to turn to, no one to trust
It's hard to find someone that won't turn to dust

Chorus:
Love and relationships, so much to bear
It can bring so much joy and also despair
When it's right it will be true, when it's wrong it will show
Love and relationships, you never really know

Bridge:

There's no telling what will happen, no way to be sure
But if you keep on searching, you'll find something that's pure
No need to be scared, no need to be blue
Take a chance on love, it'll be worth it if it's true

Chorus:
Love and relationships, so much to bear
It can bring so much joy and also despair
When it's right it will be true, when it's wrong it will show
Love and relationships, you never really know
