original text - 

Verse 1
Life's journey is full of experiences,
Some happy, some sad, some hard to believe.
From the highest of highs to the lowest of lows,
We learn to embrace all of life's ebb and flow.

Chorus
The good, the bad, the beautiful, the sad,
We've got to keep goin' through life's journey we've had.
No matter what paths we take,
We've got to remember our life's journey make.

Verse 2
Life's journey may lead to many different roads,
And it's up to us to choose which one we go.
We can take the winding way or the straight and narrow,
But either way, we'll make it through tomorrow.

Chorus
The good, the bad, the beautiful, the sad,
We've got to keep goin' through life's journey we've had.
No matter what paths we take,
We've got to remember our life's journey make.

Bridge
We've had our highs and our lows,
But we can't turn back time and undo those blows.
We can only look back and appreciate,
The strength and courage it took to make life's journey great.

Chorus
The good, the bad, the beautiful, the sad,
We've got to keep goin' through life's journey we've had.
No matter what paths we take,
We've got to remember our life's journey make.
