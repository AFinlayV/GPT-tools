Verse 1

Love can be tricky, full of heartbreak and pain
But if you just keep searching, you'll find it again
Hold onto the hope that life will bring your way
And show you a new path to true love one day

Chorus
Love is strong, and it's sweet
It's the thing that keeps us complete
It can bring us joy, and it can make us blue
But without it, we just wouldn't have a clue

Verse 2
Relationships can be hard, but they can be great too
They bring us together, when we're feeling blue
No matter what life throws our way, we can rely
On the strength of love to help us get by

Chorus
Love is strong, and it's sweet
It's the thing that keeps us complete
It can bring us joy, and it can make us blue
But without it, we just wouldn't have a clue

Bridge
We can't always trust in ourselves, but we can trust in love
It gives us the courage to carry on and rise above
So don't lose faith in love, even when it's hard to see
Just keep believing, and it will set you free

Chorus
Love is strong, and it's sweet
It's the thing that keeps us complete
It can bring us joy, and it can make us blue
But without it, we just wouldn't have a clue
